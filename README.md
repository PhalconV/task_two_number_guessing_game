# Brief Intro
This is a number guessing game that takes input from the player by asking for the to enter a value and it matches it to the one the system picks in its memory.

<<<<<<< HEAD
# Aim
- The system picks a number and
- Asks the player for input
- The system prints the result if it matches the number it picks and is stored in its memory

# Algorithm
Interacting with the algorithm takes the following step by step process;

Step 1: The system picks a number and saves it in memory

Step 2: The algorithm asks for the player to input a number (From 1 to 10). The user does this and press enter

Step 3: The system compares the input to the number it has picked and saved in memory.

Conditional operations of the algorithm comes into play using while loop and for statement

Step 4: If the user input is equals as the one in the algorithm's memory, it shows and output message "Your guess is correct"

Step 5: If the user input is higher than the one in the algorithm's memory, it shows and output message "You have guessed too high, try again"

Step 6: If the user input is lower than the one in the algorithm's memory, it shows and output message "You have guessed too low, try again"

The algorithm exits the loop if the guess is correct otherwise it starts the loop again with user input.
